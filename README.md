# miMood Journal API

## Overview
miMood is a journaling app that uses AI to track your emotions. Users can submit written entries 
and selfies, and artificial intelligence systems will scan your input. This allows for a deeper understanding of both your own mood, and of how AI interacts with human emotion.

Created by Scott Williams, Enrique Montemayor, and Silas Hallahan.
